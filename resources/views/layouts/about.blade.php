				<h2>A Communal Approach to Disaster Relief</h2>

				<hr>

				<h3>The most difficult aspect of recovery after a natural disaster is simply getting started. After an event like a hurricane, there may be countless people in need of assistance, and just as many willing to help but not knowing how they can. That's where Beacon come in.</h3>

				<br>
				
				<h3>Beacon aims to provide communities with a platform to ask for assistance, or to offer their help. Each community has a location-based activity feed, that allows others to respond to any request for aid, and help expedite the recovery process. Every time you log in, you will have direct access to your local Broadcast Feed, and the ability to broadcast your own beacon.</h3>
