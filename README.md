### A Community Forum for Disaster Relief

#### One of the most difficult parts of rebuilding after a natural disaster is connecting members of a community to help address the biggest needs in that area. Many people spend a large portion time trying to connect with friends and neighbors to figure out where they can help to begin the recovery process. Beacon seeks to give communities a platform to begin the recovery process. Beacon offers a live stream forum for community members in the same zip code to alert others of dangerous condition in the area, volunteer recovery efforts, or their own request for assistance after a disaster.
